2. The meeting must be open to all applicable general members. General members must receive notice of the meeting in accordance with the Constitution.

## II -- Review of the Agenda 

1. The first draft of the agenda is prepared by the Chairperson prior to the meeting. Agenda items should ordinarily appear in the order set forth in these rules of order.

2. The agenda belongs to all general members. The agenda may be modified only by a majority vote. This power should only be used when necessary as proper functioning of meetings and the organization requires advance planning.

3. At this point in the agenda, general members may add or delete items from the agenda and may change the order of presentation.

4. When possible, changes to the agenda should be done by acquiescence of all general members. Formal voting on the agenda is only necessary where it appears to the Chairperson that there is a disagreement.

## III -- Approval of Previous Minutes 

1. The minutes need not be read aloud but they should be entered into the organization's official minute ledger upon approval by the general membership.

2. The minutes are prepared by either the secretary or some other individual appointed by the general membership to act as recording secretary. Any general member may suggest changes to the minutes before the general membership adopts them. The suggested changes should be set forth in the minutes for the record, and then the general membership should adopt or reject such changes.

3. Minutes should state precisely each motion considered by the general membership, and identify the general members voting in favour, against, or abstaining, and whether the motion was carried. Minutes need not reflect the comments made except in those instances when the member desires to make his/her comments recorded.

4. When possible, changes to the minutes and adoption of the minutes should be done by acquiescence of all general members. Formal voting on the minutes is only necessary where it appears to the Chairperson that there is a disagreement.

3. This time should also be used for any presentations to be made to the general membership.

## V -- Open Forum 

1. It is the custom and practice of most organizations to allow general members an open forum to ask questions and speak about their concerns to an executive after a report has been provided.

4. All business must be conducted in the form of motions or resolutions adopted by a vote of the general membership.

5. No general member may speak to an issue for a second time until all other general members have had the opportunity to speak to it for the first time. Likewise, no general member may speak to an issue for a third time until all other general members have had the opportunity to speak to it for a second time.

6. When it appears to the Chairperson that all general members have had the opportunity to fully discuss the matter at hand, the Chair should announce that the item of business is ready for a vote.

## VIII -- Voting

 1. A motion to adopt a specific action by the board.

 2. A motion to postpone the item to another meeting (including fact-finding assignments to a person or committee).

 3. A motion to remove an item from consideration.

2. The general membership is limited to discussing one item of business at a time, but there are no limits to the number of motions that may be considered as to how to dispose of that item of business.

3. After the general membership has had the opportunity to discuss each motion presented for consideration, the Chairperson will call each motion presented to a vote.

4. The fact that a motion has been adopted or failed does not prevent the item of business from being added to the agenda in the future and all motions may be reconsidered at any time by the general membership.
